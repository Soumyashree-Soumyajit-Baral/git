routes were going through the service worker which again requested and returned the request so the server got 2 requests 1 from the main fetch an another from the service workers fetch.
Try using  respondWith() instead of return

Or

The additional fetch request you are seeing is an OPTIONS request (pre-flight request) which occurs when headers are passed in the request.
